abstract = {The problem of the rigid-piston radiator mounted in an infinite baffle has been studied widely for tutorial as well as for practical reasons. The resulting theory is commonly applied to model a loudspeaker in the audio-frequency range. A special function, the Struve function H1 (z), occurs in the expressions for the rigid-piston radiator. This Struve function is not readily available in programs such as Matlab or Mathcad, nor in computer languages such as FORTRAN and C. Therefore a simple and effective approximation of H1 (z) which is valid for all z is developed. Some examples of the application of the Struve function in acoustics are presented.},

abstract = {This paper intends to compare the performance of eight techniques, based on five different methods, used to find the electrical grounding parameters of a two-layered earth (resistivities and thickness) corresponding to a specific mathematical model. Parameter estimation is carried out-in such a way as to get an optimum fitting between the set of resistivity values measured in field by means of Wenner's Method, and those calculated from the mathematical model using such parameters. Firstly, the paper is devoted to presenting a review of the mathematical basis of five optimization methods used for the implementation of the different techniques subject to comparison. Secondly, the paper is dedicated to defining the implementation of the algorithms for the eight techniques. Three of them are of First Order Gradlent type, one more of Second Order (Newton Method), the fifth one is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt Method, the sixth one on the Generalized Inverse Method, the seventh one on a Quasi-Newton Method and the last one on a mixed Newton-Generalized Inverse method. Algorithms are applied to six test cases and comparison of the results is shown. Furthermore, new algorithms to improve existing procedures are presented.},

abstract = {This paper investigates numerical instability issues in the mutual impedance formula between an overhead conductor and a buried conductor proposed by Pollaczek with special refer- ence to the integrand of Pollaczek's infinite integral. The integrand shows a negative real part and positive imaginary part at a high frequency, which result in negative resistance and inductance. The reason for this is the assumption of TEM-mode propagation in Pollaczek's formula as is well known. The fact suggests that nu- merical instability of the infinite integral is caused by incorrect integrand in a high-frequency region. Based on the observations, the applicable limit of Pollacezk's formula is analytically derived. Finally, a simple closed-form formula is developed, which approx- imates Pollaczek's formula with satisfactory accuracy},

Particularly, the grounding design for substations that are built on high resistivity soil is considered. Here, possible physical rectification schemes are introduced and compared for their effectiveness from safety and cost efficiency perspectives. For this comparison, the CYMGRD program (a finite element analysis tool for AC substation grounding) is used for detailed analysis of the various schemes. An additional computer program is developed to implement the formulations of the related AC substation standards (IEEE, IEE, and Turkish National Regulations). The output of this program is compared with the finite element analysis of the high-resistivity-soil rectification schemes to investigate the validity of the formulations in these standards.},

Simple algorithms and programs are developed for calculating grounding resistance using integral equation method. Examples and results related to the several different types of conductor division into segments (rings and sticks) are presented for grounding resistance and surface leakage current density. The straight rod is a 1m-length conductor with circular cross section 1 cm radius, deeply buried in soil conductivity 0.01 S/m. The accuracy of different segmentation types is compared with low frequency module of well-known CDEGS software. Summarized results of grounding resistance for different approaches and analytical equation are presented.},

The results of a frequency-analysis study of effects connected with point values of the electromagnetic field generated within the building or due to the presence of radiation fields, namely, fields whose harmonic components, characterized by small wavelengths compared to the dimensions of the `victim' circuit, assume nonnegligible values, are reported. These effects are calculated using a procedure based on a field approach. Characterization of the electromagnetic field is ensured by a numerical procedure that permits simultaneous simulation of the protection system and analysis of the electromagnetic field by means of the method of moments used by various authors for the study of direct lightning strokes to thin-wire structures. Two distinct points of impact of the lightning stroke to the protection system are considered, and the results are compared},

abstract = {The interference caused by power transmission lines to buried gas pipelines is under investigation for many years. Situations where a pipeline is influenced by more than one power lines are more frequent nowadays, thus making the interaction more complex. Even under normal operating conditions, voltages and currents are induced on the pipeline that may pose danger to working personnel or may accelerate the corrosion of the pipeline's metal. In this paper, a case study taken from the Greek Transmission System is demonstrated. Measurements of the induced voltage at certain locations of a pipeline section are compared with theoretical calculations. These calculations comprise finite element computations and circuit analysis. Results presented show that the induced voltage on the pipeline is heavily influenced on the loading of each of the power lines, which must be known throughout the common route. For an accurate calculation of the induced parameters, it is recommended that the coupling between all conductors of the problem should be taken into consideration. Furthermore, theoretical calculations presented show the influence of the operation of installed over-voltage arresters, which connect the pipeline to mitigation grounding wires.},

Previous literature, studying less complex geometries, is extensively reviewed and found to be incomplete and inaccurate in a number of places. These deficiencies are highlighted and the methodology is presented with enough detail to allow repetition of the results. Results are shown which approximate the scenario of a leaking water-pipe, buried in the shallow sub-surface. It is shown that the trapped surface wave does not dominate in this scenario. Furthermore, it is shown that the trapped surface wave magnitude is reduced when conductivity of the fourth layer is reduced, or when the third layer thickness is increased; these results fit the qualitative expectation based on previous results.},

However, FEMM suffers from being tied to the Microsoft Windows platform, and having a slow interface to external programs. This paper presents a successful project to extract the core algorithms from FEMM, make them cross-platform and compile them into a set of libraries and command-line programs. In addition the creation of a new Matlab and Octave interface with direct access to the libraries is described with an example of its use. The libraries use only the C++ standard template libraries for maximum portability. For students and researchers, the tools can be used without knowledge of C++, but for more advanced students and those who might want to add further improvements, the code has also been substantially reorganised for clarity. The new C++ toolbox is referred to as “xfemm”, and the interface “mfemm”.},

abstract = {Low-frequency electric currents of a few milliamperes flowing through the body cause muscular contractions. In the arm such an effect may make a subject unable to let go of a live conductor. The highest currents which 99.5 percent of men and 99.5 percent of women are able to let go have been shown to be 9 and 6 mA, respectively. Currents somewhat larger than this, in the range of 20 to 40 mA, passing across the chest may arrest respiration leading to asphyxia, unconsciousness, and even death. The most common cause of death in electric shock probably is ventricular fibrillation, a condition in which the circulation is arrested and death ensues very rapidly. An analysis of available experimental data indicates that body weight and shock duration are important factors in determining the maximum current not likely to cause ventricular fibrillation. Taking a weight of 50 kg as the average for a human victim it is suggested that the relationship between current shock duration is given by I = 116/??7, where I is the current in milliamperes and T is the time in seconds. It must be stressed that this has only been shown to be valid within the range of 8 ms to 5 seconds.

@article{Das2014,
abstract = {A number of impedance-based fault location algorithms have been developed for estimating the distance to faults in a transmission network. Each algorithm has specific input data requirements and makes certain assumptions that may or may not hold true in a particular fault location scenario. Without a detailed understanding of the principle of each fault-locating method, choosing the most suitable fault location algorithm can be a challenging task. This paper, therefore, presents the theory of one-ended (simple reactance, Takagi, modified Takagi, Eriksson, and Novosel et al.) and two-ended (synchronized, unsynchronized, and current-only) impedance-based fault location algorithms and demonstrates their application in locating real-world faults. The theory details the formulation and input data requirement of each fault-locating algorithm and evaluates the sensitivity of each to the following error sources: 1) load; 2) remote infeed; 3) fault resistance; 4) mutual coupling; 5) inaccurate line impedances; 6) DC offset and CT saturation; 7) three-terminal lines; and 8) tapped radial lines. From the theoretical analysis and field data testing, the following criteria are recommended for choosing the most suitable fault-locating algorithm: 1) data availability and 2) fault location application scenario. Another objective of this paper is to assess what additional information can be gleaned from waveforms recorded by intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) during a fault. Actual fault event data captured in utility networks is exploited to gain valuable feedback about the transmission network upstream from the IED device, and estimate the value of fault resistance.},

@phdthesis{Gilbert2011,
abstract = {In every electrical installation, one of the most important aspects is adequate grounding; in particular, the grounding of high-voltage substations to protect people and equipment in the event of an electrical fault. Well-designed grounding systems ensure the performance of power systems and safety of personnel. It is desirable that the substation grounding provides a near zero resistance to remote earth. The prevailing practice of most utilities is to install a grid of horizontal ground electrodes (buried bare copper conductors) supplemented by a number of vertical ground rods connected to the grid, and by a number of equipment grounding mats and interconnecting cables. The grounding grid provides a common ground for the electrical equipment and for all metallic structures at the station. It also limits the surface potential gradient. Currently the IEEE 80-2000 standard for substations grounding [1] limits the determination of the grounding parameters (namely step, touch and ground potential rise) to that of a uniform soil model unless the Sunde graphical method is used. With the Sunde graphical method, it relies on interpretation to obtain a two layer soil model. Without the use of the graphical method, the IEEE 81-1983 [2] has several empirical equations that can be used for the two layer model; however, these equations rely on the use of images which retard the speed of calculations to the point where the overall optimization of the grounding grid (with respect to size and shape) has yet to be determined. The goal of the thesis was to improve upon the current restrictions for the grounding grid design, while minimizing the material (i.e., copper conductors) and installation costs of a grid. The first part of the research examined previous work through a combination of literature review, mathematical computations, and field measurements to validate the theoretical aspects of grid design. The thesis introduces an optimized uniform and two-layer soil with fast accurate calculations directly from soil measurements without the use of graphical methods or the use of complex image theory. Next, the thesis develops enhanced grounding parameter equations using Simpson's Rule of integration. The final part of the thesis demonstrates how it is possible to optimize the configuration of the grounding grid itself, minimizing costs, and yet still achieving a safe installation. This is the first time such an optimization is possible, and it is made possible by the techniques developed in this thesis. The techniques are applied to existing real-world grid designs, and the results obtained show the effectiveness of the method in reducing construction costs. This thesis shows how these construction and material savings are realized by utilizing a process whereby the grounding design minimizes the overall cost. The overall contribution of this thesis is the optimization of the grounding grid design by eliminating the current restrictions found in the IEEE standards 80 and 81, respectively, and offering an optimized grounding system design, starting from the soil model to the actual grounding design itself.},

@article{Guemes2004,
abstract = {Taking as given that ground resistance is independent of earth fault current, this paper presents a new way of calculating ground resistance of grounding grids using the finite-element method (FEM). Ground resistance is calculated by means of three consecutive tests, with an acceptable number of elements, and fast resolution. The results of the proposed method are compared with those measured experimentally or determined by other authors. Once ground resistance and earth fault current are known, grid potential and touch-and-step voltages are calculated. The main advantage of the method proposed here is that it permits us to analyze symmetrical and nonsymmetrical grids of any shape in uniform, two-layer, and multilayer soils. The method developed in this paper constitutes a fast-resolution industrial application, with acceptable results, for calculating the ground resistance of grounding grids of any shape.},

Examples are presented showing the effect of the non-uniform leakage in some cases. The method given herein also can be used to compute surface voltages in the vicinity of electrodes composed of wires oriented at arbitrary angles, such as combinations of stars and polygons, and the resistance to ground of such electrodes.},

abstract = {EXTECH-III magnetotelluric (MT) data acquired across the Yellowknife River Fault Zone (YRFZ), combined with LITHOPROBE MT and geomagnetic transfer function (GTF) regional data from a 130-km-long profile centred on Yellowknife, yield information about the geometries of subsurface structures as reflected by changes in electrical resistivity. Analyses of the MT data show that they can be validly interpreted in terms of two-dimensional (2-D) structures with an average dominant strike direction of approximately north-south, consistent with exposed geology and particularly the YRFZ and coincident Proterozoic faults. Models of the MT and GTF data, obtained using objective inversion, show conducting features within the fault zone that penetrate to deep crustal levels and a broad diffusive less resistive zone in the upper mantle beneath the surface trace of the YRFZ. Within the fault zone the structures have an electrical resistivity of 1000 ohm.m or less. One site, on Walsh Lake, exhibits highly anomalous responses, indicative of a significant conductor at a depth of some 250 m below the surface, that are taken to be the graphitic argillites of the Walsh Lake Formation. The crust outside the fault zone is highly resistive throughout its whole extent, with resistivity of greater than 10,000 ohm.m. The upper mantle beneath the crust is around 4,000 ohm.m, except below the fault where it is 1,000-2,000 ohm.m.},

abstract = {The simulation of electromagnetic transients is a mature field that plays an important role in the design of modern power systems. Since the first steps in this field to date, a significant effort has been dedicated to the development of new techniques and more powerful software tools. Sophisticated models, complex solution techniques and powerful simulation tools have been developed to perform studies that are of supreme importance in the design of modern power systems. The first developments of transients tools were mostly aimed at calculating over-voltages. Presently, these tools are applied to a myriad of studies (e.g. FACTS and Custom Power applications, protective relay performance, simulation of smart grids) for which detailed models and fast solution methods can be of paramount importance. This book provides a basic understanding of the main aspects to be considered when performing electromagnetic transients studies, detailing the main applications of present electromagnetic transients (EMT) tools, and discusses new developments for enhanced simulation capability. Key features: provides up-to-date information on solution techniques and software capabilities for simulation of electromagnetic transients; covers key aspects that can expand the capabilities of a transient software tool (e.g. interfacing techniques) or speed up transients simulation (e.g. dynamic model averaging); applies EMT-type tools to a wide spectrum of studies that range from fast electromagnetic transients to slow electromechanical transients, including power electronic applications, distributed energy resources and protection systems; and, illustrates the application of EMT tools to the analysis and simulation of smart grids.},

@phdthesis{Martins-Britto2017,
abstract = {This work describes the problem of electromagnetic interference between high voltage power lines and metallic pipelines, caused by inductive, conductive and capacitive coupling mechanisms, and the main risks to which people and facilities are exposed. A set of computational tools is developed to predict induced voltage and current levels on a victim circuit, due to interferences between overhead power lines and underground pipelines. The implementation takes into account the 1) calculation of soil stratification parameters for a horizontally layered model; 2) calculation of induced electromotive forces on the pipeline metal, caused by magnetic coupling; 3) calculation of transmission line sequence parameters under interference conditions; and 4) calculation of stress voltages produced by the ground potential rise (conductive coupling) under fault circumstances. The programs are validated through case studies and comparisons with results taken from software used in industry or, when possible, with direct measurements of AC potentials. Touch, step and stress voltages are studied, as well as the effects of the pipeline proximity on the transmission line parameters and the resulting impacts on short-circuit currents and performance of fault locating devices. This work highlights the importance of employing accurate and realistic computational methods, along with gathering consistent field data, especially soil resistivity measurements and records of geographic locations of nearby interfering structures. Not doing so may cause serious design errors, such as inadequate sizing of power grounding and mitigation systems, protection function and equipment, as well as fault location devices, exposing people and installations to risks.},

Such representation is more accurate than the most common procedures of engineering practice and, in several conditions, lead to results with important differences.

One of the aspects covered in the paper is the importance of properly considering the Earth's electromagnetic behaviour when calculating transmission line parameters. Some comparisons are presented for an actual 440 kV three-phase transmission line in which the soil behaviour is represented through a unique real value of conductance (the normal approach) and through the proposed model.},

@article{Mombello1996,
abstract = {Two-layer soil models are commonly used for the design of power station grounding systems. Calculations based on such models usually give correct values for the gound resistance of grounding electrodes and for the step and touch potentials on the surface of the ground. However, the two-layer model of the actual soil can give absurd results if incorrect values of the layer resistivities and the first layer thickness are used. Conventional methods of fitting the apparent resistivity curve in order to obtain those parameters do not give good results in all cases. This may happen when the soil has a multilayer structure and certain combinations of different layer resistivities exist. In this paper, an analysis of critical cases was carried out, and a novel calculation method for the parameters of the two-layer soil model is presented. The proposed method is valid for an arbitrary number of soil layers with arbitrary values of resistivity, and it is applicable to simple as well as complex grounding systems. The numerical results of this method were compared with electromagnetic field calculations carried out with a computer program based on the finite-element method. The proposed model permits the use of computer programs based on the method of images and a two-layer soil model for the design of station grounding systems buried in horizontal multilayer soil stratifications. Thus, the risk of serious calculation errors that may appear by application of the apparent resistivity fitting method can be avoided.},

The geometrical domain of a boundary-value problem is discretized using sub-domain elements, called the finite elements, and the differential equation is applied to a single element after it is brought to a “weak” integro-differential form. A set of shape functions is used to represent the primary unknown variable in the element domain.Aset of linear equations is obtained for each element in the discretized domain. A global matrix system is formed after the assembly of all elements.},

abstract = {As the availability of powerful computer resources has grown over the last three decades, the art of computation of electromagnetic (EM) problems has also grown - exponentially. Despite this dramatic growth, however, the EM community lacked a comprehensive text on the computational techniques used to solve EM problems. The first edition of Numerical Techniques in Electromagnetics filled that gap and became the reference of choice for thousands of engineers, researchers, and students. The Second Edition of this bestselling text reflects the continuing increase in awareness and use of numerical techniques and incorporates advances and refinements made in recent years. Most notable among these are the improvements made to the standard algorithm for the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and treatment of absorbing boundary conditions in FDTD, finite element, and transmission-line-matrix methods. The author also added a chapter on the method of lines. Numerical Techniques in Electromagnetics continues to teach readers how to pose, numerically analyze, and solve EM problems, give them the ability to expand their problem-solving skills using a variety of methods, and prepare them for research in electromagnetism. Now the Second Edition goes even further toward providing a comprehensive resource that addresses all of the most useful computation methods for EM problems.},

The proposed model is based on the relationships between the phase currents and voltages at both the sending and receiving ends of a single-phase line.

The proposed model was validated by using it to represent a transmission line during short-and open-circuit tests. The results obtained with the proposed model were compared with results obtained with a classical model based on modal decomposition. These comparisons show that proposed model was correctly developed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The expression is arrived at by performing an analysis of apparent resistivity in a multilayer structure as an extension of studies that have concentrated on the two-layer model. Applying a series of parameter data to this expression enabled the preparation of r-a curves for such a multilayer structure, and these curves were compared with actual r-a curves obtained from two case studies. The results showed good agreement, indicating that the proposed expression and parameter estimation technique could be practically applied to ground design problems. In particular, earth parameters for a multilayer structure obtained through the proposed method can be used for calculating the ground resistance required by deep-driven rods in a particular geologic formation.},

The pertinent equations for determining the excitation electric field along the cable are summarized, along with the expressions which relate the line current to the excitation field. These relationships for the cable current are seen to have the same form for both the transmission line and the scattering formulations. For the transmission line case, the cable current can be expressed in terms of per-unit- length impedance and admittance parameters which are functions of only the line geometry and the frequency. For the scattering case, similar line parameters can be inferred from the form of the solution for the current, but with the line parameters depending on the angles of incidence. Several numerical calculations of the line responses are provided, and these indicate that the transmission line analysis appears to provide response estimates which are smaller than those obtained using the more accurate scattering theory},

The new expression is implemented for six actual cases of two-layer earth structures involving combinations of overhead and underground conductors.

abstract = {Radio-wave transmission over the surface of the Earth is a subject of enquiry going back to the beginning of the century. In this review, an attempt is made to describe the ground-wave mechanism that is omni-present. We first call attention to the early analytical contributions of Zenneck and Sommerfeld, based on a flat-Earth model. The subsequent controversies, particularly with regard to the role of the Zenneck surface wave, are outlined. Further developments by other pioneers, such as van der Pol, Fock, Bremmer, Norton, and Millington, are reviewed, and an attempt is made to put these in a modern context. We also show that the trapped surface wave can be a significant contribution to the total ground-wave field, when the Earth boundary is sufficiently inductive. Mixed-path theory and confirming model tests by Ray King are described briefly, along with calculated propagation curves for twoand three-section paths. The bibliography includes references to related topics, such as tropospheric refraction and topographic influences View full abstract},

abstract = {The interest in travelling waves and surge phenomena in power systems has grown considerably because of the relevance to power-line carrier communication and protection, fault location, switching of unloaded lines and the recovery voltages on circuit-breakers under short-line fault conditions. The paper summarizes the solution to the single-conductor wave equation, develops the solution for the 2-conductor case by classical methods, and then indicates the rapidly growing complexity of the problem with increasing numbers of conductors when solving by classical methods. The 2-conductor case is then solved by using the method of matrix algebra. These results are shown to be valid for any number of conductors, and the concept of surge impedance and propagation coefficient for polyphase systems is introduced. The single-phase equation is shown to be a particular case of the general equation and the similarity between the results of the two cases is indicated. Examples of the matrix method are given, including a proof that symmetrical components are a particular case of the general result. The paper concludes by indicating that the method is particularly suitable for calculations carried out with a digital computer.},
